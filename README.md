# Corona_Virus_COVID19
This repository contains my code for the prediction of the model (ARIMA) that I implemented in Python (10 days before the day of the predicted number of cases) about the total number of the infections due to Covid19 in Greece and Netherlands up to date

# Prediction for Greece: 1700 - Confirmed cases: 1615...At least, I think that I am good enough at my expertise..ðŸ™‚
